App Design — Creating the look & feel of your app
Simplicity is one of the golden rules of app design. The audience should have an enjoyable, positive experience when using your app. Whether their objective is reading content, watching a video or enrolling in a course, every action should be clear and concise throughout the app. Our approach is to create an app design that strengthens your company’s brand while ensuring ease of use and simplicity for your audience.

The app design process starts with a pen and paper to sketch page layouts, wire-frames, sitemaps and menu structures. Digital design concepts are then created incorporating your company’s brand guidelines for a personalised look and feel. You will be presented with a variety of website design concepts to review. Feedback on the design concepts is essential to give you the opportunity to express your thoughts on the design and make alterations where desired before the final sign-off. Once finalised, the design files will be supplied to you in Photoshop (.psd) and JPEG formats.
