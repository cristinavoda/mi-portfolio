Responsive Website Design â€” Targeting desktops, laptops, tablets and smart phones
Having a responsive layout means that your website fluidly resizes for optimal viewing regardless of the screen size or device (desktop computer, laptop, tablet or smart phone). This ensures ease of use and a better audience experience without the need for panning, scrolling or resizing. Your audience is much more likely to enjoy viewing your website on a mobile device without needing to zoom in to read the text or to find the navigation menu.
